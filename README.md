## Problem Statement  

Financial markets are heavily influenced by news coverage. Investors, analysts, and policymakers rely on news to gauge **sentiment, frequency, and focus of coverage**. Without structured analysis, itâ€™s difficult to answer questions like:  

- Which companies are most frequently covered?  
- How has news coverage evolved over the years?  
- Are there patterns in publishing by weekdays?  
- What are the most recurring financial headlines?

## Objectives
1. Perform **data preprocessing and cleaning** on 2003â€“2020 Indian financial news data.  
2. Build an **interactive dashboard** to explore:  
   - Articles published over time.  
   - Company-wise article distribution.  
   - Day-of-week publishing trends.  
   - Top recurring headlines.  
3. Deliver **business insights** to support analysts and decision-makers.
