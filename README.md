📊 Dashboard Insights

1. Articles Over Time (2003–2020):

News coverage increased significantly after 2008, reflecting the global financial crisis and its impact on Indian markets.

Peaks observed around 2015–2017, aligning with major banking/market reforms and economic events.



2. Articles by Weekday:

Financial reporting is highest mid-week (Tuesday–Thursday).

Weekends show very low activity, suggesting analysts and traders rely on weekday updates.



3. Articles by Company:

SBI (State Bank of India) appears frequently, showing strong media attention on the banking sector.

This type of analysis can be extended to other institutions to compare coverage.



4. Top Headlines:

Frequently recurring headlines highlight banking, stock market indices (NSE, BSE, Sensex, NIFTY), and economic growth/decline.

Themes reveal investor sentiment and market-moving news across years.
